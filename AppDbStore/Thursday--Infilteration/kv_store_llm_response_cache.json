Examples include:  \n  - `192.168.10.8:52590/6` → `54.192.48.203:443/6` (46 forward packets, 58 backward packets)  \n  - `192.168.10.17:56424/6` → `52.33.61.7:443/6` (16 forward packets, 13 backward packets).  \n- **Internal ↔ Internal Traffic**: Limited internal communications (e.g., `192.168.10.5:53433/6` → `192.168.10.3:445/6`), often using SMB port 445.  \n\n#### 2. **Threat Levels**  \n- **Medium Risk**: Flows marked as \"normal\" but with medium threat levels due to `irregular_timing` patterns (e.g., long durations exceeding 100,000ms with low packet rates).  \n- **Low Risk**: Short-duration flows (e.g., 10–100ms) with minimal data transfer, often ACK-only packets (e.g., `192.168.10.17:39137/6` ↔ `23.203.79.138:443/6`).  \n\n#### 3. **Anomalous Indicators**  \n- **Suspicious Timing**: 14 relationships flagged for `irregular_timing`, such as `192.168.10.8:52577/6` → `54.192.48.32:443/6` (116,472,521ms duration).  \n- **High Bandwidth Exceptions**: UDP port 123 (NTP) flows (e.g., `192.168.10.50:123/17` → `4.53.160.75:123/17`) show unusually high bytes/sec (1.8M) despite being labeled \"normal.\"  \n\n#### 4. **Data Transfer Characteristics**  \n- **Asymmetrical Traffic**: Web server responses often dwarf client requests (e.g., `172.217.12.206:443/6` sent 12 bytes to `192.168.10.14:63217/6`, but received 0 bytes).  \n- **Protocol-Specific Behaviors**: TCP flows frequently use PSH flags (push data), while UDP flows (protocol 17) lack flag patterns but exhibit high throughput.  \n\n---\n\n### References  \n1.

These flows show:  \n- Extremely low packet rates (0.33–1.72 packets/sec) despite large durations (e.g., 117M milliseconds)  \n- Suspiciously long-lived sessions with minimal data transfer (e.g., 0 bytes over 9M ms in Flow ID 192.168.10.8-69.64.147.32-52535-443-6)  \n- Flagged as \"irregular_timing\" in 18+ relationships (KG Relationships 1,4-9,14,19-22,38,40-45)  \n\n#### 2. **Protocol/Port Concentration**  \n- **HTTP/HTTPS Dominance**: 80% of external communications target ports 80/443, with 54.192.48.203 (AWS IP) and 72.21.91.29 (Amazon) being frequent destinations.  \n- **Internal SMB Activity**: Port 445 traffic between internal endpoints (192.168.10.3/5/8/9/15) shows bidirectional data exchange (e.g., 8,238→4,208 bytes in Flow ID 192.168.10.3-192.168.10.15-445-55583-6).  \n- **NTP Traffic**: UDP/123 communications with external servers (72.38.129.202, 4.53.160.75) show normal behavior but high frequency (KG Relationships 47-48,51).  \n\n#### 3. **Threat Level Distribution**  \n- **Medium-Risk Web Traffic**: 63% of web server connections are MEDIUM threat level due to:  \n  - Asymmetric packet ratios (e.g., 76→106 packets in Flow ID 192.168.10.8-54.192.48.203-52593-443-6)  \n  - Large backward byte volumes (up to 209,485 bytes)  \n- **Low-Risk Internal Flows**: SMB/NTP communications classified LOW threat despite anomalous timing indicators.  \n\n#### 4. **Internal Network Behavior**  \n- **Endpoint 192.168.10.8**: Acts as major internal hub with:  \n  - 35+ unique outbound connections  \n  - Repeated connections to suspicious external IPs (e.g., 213.239.195.215, 89.255.249.54)  \n  - Multiple ephemeral ports (525xx range) in use  \n- **Consistent ACK Flags**: 72% of TCP flows show ACK=1 without SYN/FIN, suggesting established-but-unusual persistent connections.  \n\n#### 5. **NTP Server Communications**  \n- **UDP/123 Patterns**:  \n  - Bi-directional 48-byte packet exchanges (typical of NTP)  \n  - Connections to diverse geographic locations (Canada, France, Germany)  \n  - All classified LOW threat with normal behavior scores  \n\n---\n\n### References  \n[KG] Relationships 1,5,7,38,42 (unknown_source)  \n[KG] Sources 1,5,7,15,24 (./AppDbStore/Thursday--Infilteration)",

Multiple internal endpoints (e.g., 192.168.10.16, 192.168.10.17) connect to it with medium threat levels and high packet size variance, suggesting potential suspicious activity like data exfiltration or DDoS patterns [KG].  \n- **DNS Server Utilization**: 192.168.10.3:53/17 (DNS Server) shows 63 normal flows, primarily handling UDP-based DNS queries from internal endpoints (e.g., 192.168.10.17). This aligns with expected network behavior.  \n- **NTP Traffic**: Multiple endpoints (e.g., 192.168.10.17:123/17) communicate with external NTP servers (e.g., 91.189.91.157:123) via UDP, likely for time synchronization—a normal but security-sensitive activity.  \n\n#### 2. **Traffic Patterns**\n- **High-Volume HTTP/HTTPS Flows**:  \n  - 31.13.71.7:443/6 (Facebook-owned IP) and 185.86.137.17:443/6 show moderate traffic with anomalous flags, suggesting potential unauthorized access or encrypted data transfers.  \n  - Repeated connections to 199.59.88.242:443/6 (Twitter-owned IP) from 192.168.10.17:42105/6 with zero-byte transfers may indicate heartbeat signals or failed authentication attempts.  \n- **Low-Impact Flows**: Short-lived TCP sessions (e.g., 192.168.10.16:50094 → 23.21.56.196:80) with minimal data transfer suggest routine web requests.  \n\n#### 3. **Threat Indicators**\n- **Suspicious Medium-Threat Flows**:  \n  - 28 relationships to 199.244.48.55:443/6 exhibit \"high_packet_size_variance\" (e.g., 192.168.10.16:42050 → 199.244.48.55:443), which could indicate obfuscated payloads or irregular communication patterns.  \n  - Protocol 6 (TCP) dominates anomalous flows, while UDP flows (e.g., DNS/NTP) remain normal.  \n- **Internal Anomalies**: 192.168.10.3:445/6 (SMB) and 192.168.10.3:389/6 (LDAP) show single anomalous flows—critical to investigate for potential lateral movement.  \n\n#### 4. **Recommendations**\n1. Investigate 199.244.48.55:443/6 for potential C2 server activity.  \n2. Audit DNS logs for 192.168.10.3:53/17 to rule out DNS tunneling.  \n3. Monitor NTP traffic for protocol abuse (e.g., amplification attacks).  \n4. Inspect SMB/LDAP endpoints (192.168.10.3) for unauthorized access.  \n\n---\n\n### References  \n1.

Internal endpoints like 192.168.10.14, 192.168.10.17, and 192.168.10.19 frequently query this DNS server using UDP (protocol 17). These interactions are low-threat and involve typical DNS resolution patterns.\n\n#### 2. **Web Server Communications**  \nExternal web servers (e.g., 172.217.10.238:80/443, 121.29.54.141:443) receive TCP (protocol 6) traffic from internal endpoints. Notable examples:  \n- **Anomalous HTTPS flows** to 172.217.10.238:443 (Medium threat) with irregular timing patterns.  \n- **Normal HTTP/HTTPS traffic** to services like 23.21.56.196:80 and 104.97.125.160:443, often with low data volumes (e.g., 6-12 bytes/packet).  \n\n#### 3. **Anomalous Endpoints**  \n- **192.168.10.14:57701/6** and **192.168.10.14:57700/6** show medium-threat HTTP flows to 104.97.114.112:80 with irregular timing.  \n- **192.168.10.19:38355/6** exhibits anomalous TCP traffic to 172.217.10.238:80 (Medium threat).  \n\n#### 4. **NTP Synchronization**  \nInternal endpoint 192.168.10.17:123 communicates with external NTP servers (e.g., 129.128.12.20:123, 91.189.91.157:123) via UDP, marked as normal low-threat activity.  \n\n#### 5. **High-Bandwidth Exceptions**  \nA few flows (e.g., 192.168.10.16 ↔ 199.244.48.55:443) show unusually high bandwidth (2.3 MB/sec) but are classified as normal, suggesting authorized bulk data transfers.  \n\n---\n\n### References  \n1.

Port 80 Flows with Elevated Transfer Rates  \nMultiple flows to port 80 exhibit high throughput:  \n- Relationships 28–32, 35–37, 39–41 show flows to port 80 with bytes/sec ranging from 1,662 to 4,000,000.  \n- Relationship 8 (port 443) has 4,000,000 bytes/sec, but port 80 flows like Relationship 34 show 139,860 packets/sec.  \nNo explicit malicious labeling, but speed aligns with potential payload staging.  \n\n#### 3.

However, explicit C2 patterns (beaconing, RST terminations) are absent in the KB data. Port 80 activity shows elevated traffic but is not flagged as malicious.  \n\n### References  \n1.

      "return": "### Analysis of Nuclear Exploit Kit Patterns\n\n#### 1. Successful C2 Handshakes (SYN/ACK Flags)  \nSeveral flows show SYN=1 and ACK=1 patterns without RST flags:  \n- Flow 22 (192.168.10.19:40137 → 173.194.208.109:465)  \n- Flow 25 (192.168.10.9:4904 → 173.194.208.109:465)  \nThese indicate successful TCP handshakes but lack sufficient volume to confirm C2 activity conclusively.\n\n#### 2. High Throughput to 67.215.1.162  \nNo flows involving 67.215.1.162 are documented in the Knowledge Base. This IP does not appear in entity or relationship records.\n\n#### 3. Short-Lived Command Delivery  \nNo flows match this pattern. High backward packets (e.g., 24 packets in Flow 4) correlate with extended durations (116M+ ms), contradicting \"rapid delivery\" criteria.\n\n#### 4. HTTP Exploit Payloads  \nPort 80 flows (e.g., Flow 2: 23.50.75.27:80 → 192.168.10.17:36074) show 0 forward bytes, inconsistent with large exploit payloads. Mean packet lengths remain within normal ranges.\n\n#### 5. Beaconing Behavior  \nSource IP 192.168.10.17 communicates with multiple external IPs (52.33.61.7, 23.50.75.27, etc.), but traffic ratios vary significantly (e.g., 1:1 vs. 26:24 packet ratios). No consistent down/up pattern observed.\n\n#### 6. Irregular Timing for 67.215.1.162  \nNo data available for this IP address in the provided records.\n\n#### 7. Standardized C2 Response Sizes  \nClusters of flows exhibit identical backward packet lengths:  \n- 6-byte responses in Flows 8, 9, 24, 51-53  \n- 12-byte responses in Flows 5, 6, 18  \nThis consistency aligns with potential C2 response standardization.\n\n---\n\n**References**  \n[KG] ./AppDbStore/Thursday--Infilteration (Flows 2,5,8,22,25)  \n[KG] ./AppDbStore/Thursday--Infilteration (Flow 4 irregular_timing pattern)  \n[KG] ./AppDbStore/Thursday--Infilteration (Port 80 analysis)  \n[KG] ./AppDbStore/Thursday--Infilteration (192.168.10.17 communications)  \n[KG] ./AppDbStore/Thursday--Infilteration (6-byte response clusters)",
