Flow rates show:\n- Typical example: 1,492 bytes transferred in 34ms = **43,882 bytes/sec**  \n- Packet rates: 24 packets in 34ms = **705 packets/sec**  \nThese values indicate high-throughput HTTPS sessions but lack explicit confirmation of malicious patterns.\n\n#### 2. Connection Persistence Analysis\n- **Flow Duration**: All observed flows last ≤35ms (e.g., Relationship 36: 34ms, Relationship 42: 28ms)  \n- **SYN/ACK Ratios**: Consistent 3:22 SYN:ACK ratios observed (e.g., Relationship 36), matching normal TCP handshakes rather than persistent C2 channels.\n\n#### 3. Data Exfiltration Indicators\n- **Backward Packet Spikes**: Multiple flows to 193.200.16.175 show backward bytes exceeding forward bytes (e.g., Relationship 36: 1,492B forward vs 2,342B backward)  \n- **Bulk Transfer Patterns**: Tagged as \"high_bulk_transfer\" in Relationships 26-28,30,32-34 but without temporal spikes.\n\n#### 4.

Beaconing Behavior\nNo data available in KB for Active/Idle Mean metrics. Short flow durations (≤35ms) contradict typical beaconing intervals.\n\n#### 6. RST Flag Analysis\nMinimal RST activity observed (e.g., Relationship 22: 1 RST flag). No repeated failed connection attempts detected.\n\n#### 7.
