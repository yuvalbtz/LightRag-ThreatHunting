All observed flows show 1:1 source-target relationships (e.g., 192.168.10.16→199.244.48.55, 192.168.10.19→172.217.10.238).\n\n2. **Flow Characteristics**  \n- **199.244.48.55:443/6** shows high throughput (573K Bytes/s, 578 Packets/s) but normal Down/Up Ratio=1  \n- **172.217.10.238:80/6** has Down/Up Ratio=0 but extremely low throughput (20 Bytes/s, 0.28 Packets/s)  \n- **192.168.10.3:53/17** demonstrates UDP-based high throughput (848K Bytes/s, 16K Packets/s) but normal DNS port usage\n\n3. **Attack Type Analysis**  \nThe combination of high throughput + ratio imbalance required for volumetric DDoS (e.g., UDP/ICMP floods) or application-layer DDoS (e.g., HTTP floods) isn't fully satisfied by any entity. The single-source relationships and lack of concentrated traffic patterns suggest normal application traffic rather than coordinated attacks.\n\n**References**  \n[KG] ./AppDbStore/Friday--DDos (Network Entity: 192.168.10.16:42424/6)  \n[KG] ./AppDbStore/Friday--DDos (Network Entity: 192.168.10.3:53/17)  \n[KG] ./AppDbStore/Friday--DDos (Network Entity: 172.217.10.238:80/6)",
