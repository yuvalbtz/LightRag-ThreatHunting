      "return": "### Analysis of Boleto Malware Communication Patterns\n\n#### 1. SSL/TLS-Encrypted C2 Traffic (Port 443)  \nNo flows to port 443 show elevated SYN/ACK flag counts indicative of SSL/TLS-encrypted C2. Flows to web servers like 199.101.134.238:443 (KG-32) and 216.58.202.14:443 (KG-78) exhibit normal TCP handshake patterns (SYN:3, ACK:15-19) with low threat levels.  \n\n#### 2. HTTP Downloads (Port 80 to 65.181.125.193)  \nSignificant HTTP activity observed:  \n- Flow ID `a775c7dd-2d77-4029-acb3-db09f7bc2a69` (DC-33) to 65.181.125.193:80 shows **1,653,947 bytes downloaded** vs 3,310 bytes uploaded (Down/Up Ratio ≈ 499:1), consistent with large file downloads.  \n- Flow characteristics include PSH flags (1,041) and sustained ACK sequences, typical of payload delivery.  \n\n#### 3. Short-Duration TCP Flows to Port 443  \nFlows to 443 (e.g., 199.101.134.238:443 in KG-32) have durations of 17–18ms but lack explicit Active Mean metrics. No conclusive evidence of IRC-based botnet commands.  \n\n#### 4. Data Exfiltration via HTTP (Port 80)  \nFlow ID `a775c7dd-2d77-4029-acb3-db09f7bc2a69` (DC-33) demonstrates **asymmetric traffic**:  \n- Forward bytes: 1,653,947 (outbound)  \n- Backward bytes: 3,310 (inbound)  \nThis matches exfiltration patterns where compromised hosts send large payloads to external servers.  \n\n#### 5. RST Flags to Untrusted IPs  \nNo flows with multiple RST flags observed. Single RST flags appear in normal connection teardowns (e.g., flow ID `9028a714-95e4-4c2c-8140-4cd3cd9e2621` to 65.181.113.187:80).  \n\n#### 6. Beaconing Activity  \nLow Bytes/s with high Packets/s not observed. Most flows show proportional byte/packet rates (e.g., 29.67 bytes/sec and 0.13 packets/sec in KG-22).  \n\n#### 7. Irregular Idle Mean in HTTP Flows  \nIdle Mean metrics are unavailable in the provided data.  \n\n---\n\n### Key Findings  \n1. **High-Risk Download Activity**: HTTP flows to 65.181.125.193:80 (DC-33) suggest large file transfers, potentially malicious payloads.  \n2. **Data Exfiltration**: Asymmetric HTTP traffic to 65.181.125.193:80 aligns with data theft patterns.  \n\n### References  \n1.
