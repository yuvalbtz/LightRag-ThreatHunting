      "return": "### Dreambot Infection Pattern Analysis\n\n#### 1. High Down/Up Ratio on Port 80  \nNo flows with destination port 80 exhibit high Down/Up ratios. Observed flows to port 80 (31.11.33.145:80/tcp and 164.132.120.220:80/tcp) show **0 backward bytes** with minimal forward traffic (60 bytes), indicating negligible data transfer in both directions.  \n**Source IPs**: None  \n\n#### 2. Repeated SYN Flags for C2 Check-ins  \nNo repeated SYN flag patterns detected. All TCP flows show **SYN:0 or SYN:1** with single packets, and flow durations of **0ms** (e.g., Flow ID pcap-1633). No sustained communication suggestive of C2 check-ins.  \n**Pattern Found**: No  \n\n#### 3. High Throughput for Data Exfiltration  \nAll flows show **0.00 bytes/sec and 0.00 packets/sec** flow rates. No instances of elevated throughput matching data exfiltration patterns.  \n**Flows Detected**: None  \n\n#### 4. RST Flags with Low Fwd Packets  \nOne flow (10.12.29.102:49162/tcp → 31.11.33.145:80/tcp) has **RST:1** with **1 forward packet**, but no correlation to known Dreambot IPs. Threat level is marked **LOW** with no suspicious indicators.  \n**Correlation**: None  \n\n#### 5. Tor Traffic Analysis  \nNo flows to Tor-associated ports (9001, 9030). Observed DNS (53) and HTTP (80) traffic shows **Idle Mean = 0ms** and consistent protocol usage, unrelated to Tor.  \n**Tor Activity**: Not detected  \n\n#### 6. Asymmetrical Packet Lengths  \nAll flows exhibit asymmetry (e.g., 60 forward bytes vs. 0 backward bytes), but this matches normal HTTP/DNS behavior in the dataset. No C2 command channel signatures identified.  \n\n#### 7. Beaconing Interval Analysis  \nAll flows have **0ms duration**, failing to meet the \"exceeds 10s\" criterion. No beaconing patterns detected.  \n\n### References  \n1. [KG] ./AppDbStore/2017-12-29-nfection-traffic (Flow IDs pcap-1632, pcap-2, pcap-2000)  \n2.

All flows show minimal data transfer (60–90 bytes) with 1 packet in either direction, resulting in either a 1:1 ratio or unidirectional transfers.  \n\n#### 2. **Elevated Flow Metrics on Port 80**  \nFlows to port 80 (e.g., `31.11.33.145:80/tcp` and `164.132.120.220:80/tcp`) exhibit low throughput (0.00 bytes/sec and 0.00 packets/sec) with 60–66 bytes transferred. No evidence of high-volume malicious file transfers.  \n\n#### 3. **Short-Duration Beaconing Flows**  \nThe internal IP `10.12.29.102` communicates with two external IPs (`31.11.33.145` and `164.132.120.220`) via TCP ports 49162 and 49163, respectively. These flows have 0ms duration and are marked \"normal,\" but the high count (1630 and 368 flows) and short duration align superficially with C2 patterns.  \n\n#### 4. **RST Flag Terminations**  \nFlows between `10.12.29.102:49162/tcp` and `31.11.33.145:80/tcp` include RST+ACK flags, indicating abrupt terminations after successful handshakes (ACK=1). While consistent with exploit-like behavior, these are classified as low-threat.  \n\n#### 5. **Packet Length Deviations**  \nNo notable deviations observed. Initial and subsequent flows show consistent forward packet lengths (60–90 bytes) and zero backward bytes.  \n\n#### 6. **High Backward Packets for Payload Staging**  \nAll flows to external IPs on port 80 show **0 backward packets**, inconsistent with repeated server responses.  \n\n#### 7. **Periodic Communication Clusters**  \nNo data on Active Mean/Idle Mean values in the Knowledge Base.  \n\n---\n\n### References  \n1.
