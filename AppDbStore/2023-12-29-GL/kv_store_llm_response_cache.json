Asymmetric Traffic Patterns  \nFlow 59 ([KG] unknown_source) exhibits extreme forward/backward disparity:  \n- Mean forward packet length: 106.6 bytes  \n- Mean backward packet length: 1,327.7 bytes  \n- 12.5:1 backward dominance suggests large payload deliveries  \n\n#### 5. Persistent Connection Patterns  \nFlow 35 ([KG] ./AppDbStore/2023-12-29-GL) to 185.68.16.114:443 demonstrates:  \n- 100ms active duration (99% of flow lifetime)  \n- Low 31.46 bytes/sec throughput  \n- Uncommon destination (1 occurrence in dataset)  \n\n#### 7. Command Channel Clustering  \nTCP protocol 6 flows to 74.208.236.120:443 cluster shows:  \n- Consistent protocol usage across 8 flows  \n- Forward packet dominance in flows 54-55 (8 vs 7 packets)  \n- Synchronized PSH/ACK flag patterns (PSH=4-6, ACK=13-15)  \n\n**No evidence found for**:  \n- RST flag spikes (all flows show RST ≤ 1)  \n- Clear active/idle time metrics in provided data  \n\n---\n\n**References**  \n1.
